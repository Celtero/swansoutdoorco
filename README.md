# Swan’s Lawn & Landscaping — Quick Website

This is a simple, fast-loading one-page website designed to drive phone calls for **landscaping / yard construction**.

## What to edit first
1. **Replace the logo**
   - Put your logo image in: `assets/logo.jpg`
   - Keep the file name exactly: `logo.jpg`

2. **(Optional) Add a favicon & share image**
   - `assets/favicon.png` (32x32 or 48x48)
   - `assets/og-image.png` (1200x630)

If you don't add those, the site still works — the browser just won't show a custom icon/share image.

## Deploy options (fast)
### Option A: Netlify (drag & drop)
1. Zip this folder or keep it unzipped.
2. Go to Netlify, choose **Add new site → Deploy manually**
3. Drag the folder contents (or zip) into Netlify.
4. Point your domain to Netlify.

### Option B: GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo and upload these files.
2. Enable Pages in repo settings.
3. Point your domain to the GitHub Pages URL.

## Notes
- The **callback form** doesn't require a backend — it opens a text message to (402) 676-3522 with the customer's details.
- Phone links are clickable on mobile.

Need a second page (pricing, project gallery, FAQ, reviews)? Tell me and I’ll expand it while keeping the same design.
